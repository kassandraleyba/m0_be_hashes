# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

    - I struggled with hashes_2. I got some feedback and reviewed notes and figured it out! I think I was using an extra variable somewhere in the beginning. Now, I have the hang of it!

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
   
   - When I'm reading over the lessons and learning new vocabulary, I find it most helpful to physically write the notes down. When I'm learning how to put the code together, I usually prefer screenshots so I can reference the code later, writing any key points, and working on exercises. I think of it all as notes I can refer to later, especially when assignments start to get more complex. I do find check-ins and the screen recording assignments helpful as well!

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
   
   - I try to solve the problem in the code first, but if I'm not getting the result I'm looking for, I lean into google and my notes.
