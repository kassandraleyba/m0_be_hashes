# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

    - I struggled with hashes_2. I was able to return values but I am a little confused about how to use a method within a method. For example, I was trying to call the method keys to login_statuses on line 70 and it kept returning with an error message. I thought to attach it to the variable login_statuses on line 69 instead and that worked. Am I going in the right direction or is there a better way? I tried calling another method after .keys and before .each on line 69 and received an error message. This makes me feel unsure about the syntax I used. Any tips/feedback would be great! 

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
   
   - When I'm reading over the lessons and learning new vocabulary, I find it most helpful to physically write the notes down. I use different colored pens to keep track of the new terms and tips that are provided. When I'm learning how to put the code together, I usually prefer screenshots so I can reference the code later, writing any key points, and working on exercises. I think of it all as notes I can refer to later, especially when assignments start to get more complex. I do find check-ins and the screen recording assignments helpful as well!

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
   
   - I try to solve the problem in the code first, but if I'm not getting the result I'm looking for, I lean into google and my notes.
